We offer personal planning services where personal planning documents such as representation
agreements and advance directives are discussed, often in conjunction with the preparation of a client’s
will.

In British Columbia, a representation agreement is an important document which specifies who has the
right to make decisions in relation to healthcare on your behalf.

This personal planning document includes refusal of life support and healthcare decisions that are
important to the individual. The agreement is valuable for individuals with no partner or children, or if
their children are in conflict with one another about a decision involving the individual’s health.
We will work together with families to define a representative they see fit to act on behalf of the
individual.

A Representation Agreement can include decisions involving but not limited to:

- Routine finances
- Health and personal care
- Refusal or consent to life-support treatment and care
- Consent to medical procedures
- Living arrangements

Our clients often come to our office looking for a “living will”. It is important to note that we do not have
such document in British Columbia. The document that is most similar to a living will is known as an
advance directive. An advance directive differs from a representation agreement as it lists your healthcare
wishes and does not appoint a representative to act for you. We consult with our clients about this and
can assist with the preparation of advance directives.
