### Real Estate Conveyancing

Purchasing and selling your property is one of the biggest decisions and financial investments of your life.
We are here to help you through the process — also known as conveyance — from when property is
conveyed from one party to the other, i.e., the seller (vendor) to the buyer (purchaser). We will support
you with the necessary legal documents to make the transition to/from home ownership as smooth as
possible.

We also assist clients with commercial purchases, private transactions, and family transfers of real estate
property.

Other real estate services we can assist you include changing your name on title, transmission of a joint
tenant, and change of address on title.

### How it works

Land ownership in British Columbia is recorded in the Land Title Office. As your notary public, we will
assist you with the following:

- **Transfer**: preparation of the legal forms that needed to transfer property from the Transferor to the
  Transferee
- **Mortgage**: preparation of the required land title forms and lender forms necessary to complete the
  mortgage of the property
- **Property Transfer Tax**: preparation of the necessary forms and remitting the tax to the Ministry of
  Finance on your behalf
- **Statement of Adjustments**: in any transaction whether buyer or seller, there is a statement of adjustments
  which reflect the credits and debits in your transactions. Any adjustments such as property taxes and
  strata maintenance fees are reflected on this document
- **Strata Property Management Forms**: we assist you in obtaining the necessary strata forms necessary to
  complete your transaction and ensure all strata fees are paid for.
- **Sate of Title Certificate**: at the end of your transaction, we will obtain a State of Title Certificate from
  the Land Title Office which proves that you are the registered owner of the property.
