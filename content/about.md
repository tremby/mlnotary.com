Based in South Vancouver, Marine Landing Notary Public was founded by Jonathan Wong in 2017 with a vision to provide access to affordable legal services while maintaining the profession’s ideology of impeccable integrity and practising in a tradition of trust.

Prior to opening his own firm, Jonathan spent more than a decade working in the legal industry as a legal assistant and paralegal alongside his father, George Wong.
After graduating with a Bachelor of Legal Studies (Paralegal) degree from Capilano University and a Master of Arts (Applied Legal Studies) from Simon Fraser University, Jonathan was commissioned as a notary public by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in 2017.

Since 2017, Marine Landing Notary Public has helped thousands of clients with their legal needs relating to real estate, personal planning, and notarizations.

Marine Landing Notary Public is operated by Jonathan Wong Notary Corporation.
