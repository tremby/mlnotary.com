Use this calculator to find out
how much transfer tax will be payable when you buy your home.

If you're a first-time home buyer, or the home is newly built,
you might qualify for an exemption.
Depending on the value of the home this can save you a lot of money!

### Is this up to date for the 2024 changes?

Yes,
this calculator is updated to take into account the April 2024 changes to the exemption rules,
and assumes a registration date of April 1 2024 or later.

### Why isn't the exemption applying?

Even if you otherwise qualify,
there's no exemption if the value of the home is greater than the maximum for the exemption,
which is $860,000 for first-time buyers,
and $1,150,000 for newly-built homes.

### Does this calculator work for commercial property?

No, this calculator covers only residential property.

### Where can I get more information?

The Government of BC website is the best place to look.

### My situation is more complicated!

This calculator is designed to cover only simpler cases.

Things get more tricky if, for example,
only some of a group of buyers qualifies for an exemption,
or if the property is not residential,
or if other exemptions not covered by the calculator apply.
