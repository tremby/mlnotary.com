# Real estate purchase and sale services

Buying or selling a property is one of the most important decisions and financial investments you'll make.
At Marine Landing Notary Public, we guide you through the real estate conveyancing process, ensuring a seamless transfer of property ownership from seller (vendor) to buyer (purchaser).
We handle all necessary legal documents to make your transition to or from homeownership as smooth as possible.

Our services extend beyond residential transactions --
we also assist with commercial property purchases, private real estate transactions, and family transfers of property.

Additional real estate notary services include:

- Changing the name or address on a property title
- Transmission of a joint tenant
- Other title updates as required

## How it works

Land ownership in British Columbia is recorded in the Land Title Office.
As your notary public, we will assist you with the following:

- **Transfer of property**:
  We prepare the legal forms required to transfer property ownership from the transferor to the transferee.
- **Mortgage documentation**:
  We handle the necessary land title forms and lender documents to complete your mortgage transaction.
- **Property transfer tax (PTT)**:
  We prepare the PTT forms and remit the tax to the Ministry of Finance on your behalf.
  Use [our PTT calculator](/ptt-calculator/) for a quick estimate.
- **Statement of adjustments**:
  Whether you're buying or selling, we prepare a statement that details the credits and debits,
  including property taxes and strata maintenance fees.
- **Strata property management forms**:
  We assist in obtaining the necessary strata forms to ensure all strata fees are up to date.
- **State of title certificate**:
  Upon completion, we will obtain a state of title certificate from the Land Title Office,
  confirming your status as the registered owner.
