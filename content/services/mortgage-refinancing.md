# Mortgage refinancing services

Refinancing your mortgage allows you to leverage the equity in your home to access funds for home renovations, tuition, investments, debt consolidation, or other major life decisions.
Many homeowners in the Lower Mainland have significant equity in their homes, either from paying off a mortgage in the past or from an increase of home value due to market conditions.
When paying out an existing loan and obtaining a new loan, this is known as mortgage refinancing.

At Marine Landing Notary Public, we guide you through the mortgage refinancing process by providing expert legal advice,
preparing all necessary documentation,
and managing the disbursement of mortgage funds to help you meet your financial goals.
