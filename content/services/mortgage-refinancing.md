### Mortgage Refinancing

A mortgage gives an individual the opportunity to leverage the value of their home to access funds for
renovations, tuition, investments, debt consolidation, or other life decisions.
Many homeowners in the Lower Mainland have significant equity in their homes, either by paying off a mortgage in the past or an
increase of home value due to market conditions. When paying out an existing loan and obtaining a new
loan, this is known as mortgage refinancing.

We help navigate the refinancing process by providing legal advice, preparation of the necessary
mortgage documentation, and handling mortgage proceeds to meet the needs of our clientsâ€™ life decisions.
