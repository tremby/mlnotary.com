### Wills

> Making a will is an important part of planning for your family’s future. If you die without a will, your
> property will be divided according to B.C. law, and the costs to administer your estate will increase.
> You’ll also be giving up the right to appoint the guardian of your choice for any children in your care. <br><br><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/family-social-

Under the provincial Wills, Estates and Succession Act (WESA), a will is a legal document that provides
instructions which one must follow upon a person’s death regarding the handling of their estate.

We prepare and witness a will tailored to your needs and help you define the executor of your will, the
guardian for your children, and the distribution of your estate. All these important decisions should be
made carefully and in complete trust.

### Who Should Have a Will?

Adults in BC who:

- Own property, including real estate, vehicles, and/or other assets;
- Have a dependent spouse or children;
- Wish to have someone they know and trust take care of their estate after their death.

We will prepare a will that fits your needs at a reasonable cost. If you own assets in British Columbia as
well as around the world, it is possible to have a will that relates only with your British Columbia assets.

### Wills Process

If you wish for us to assist you in the preparation of your will, please contact our office and we will book
a time for an initial consultation where we can discuss your needs and wishes. We might also bring up
other issues for your consideration. We will then draft your will and have you come in for a second
appointment to review and sign the will.
