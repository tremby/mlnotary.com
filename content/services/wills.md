### Wills and estate planning services

> Making a will is an important part of planning for your family's future.
> If you die without a will, your property will be divided according to BC law, and the costs to administer your estate will increase.
> You'll also be giving up the right to appoint the guardian of your choice for any children in your care.

Under British Columbia’s Wills, Estates and Succession Act (WESA),
a will is a legal document that provides instructions on how a person’s estate should be managed after their death.
Creating a will is essential to ensure that your wishes are respected and that your loved ones are taken care of.

At Marine Landing Notary Public, we assist in the preparation and witnessing of your will, tailored to your specific needs.
We help you define key roles, including your executor, the guardian for your children, and the distribution of your estate.
These decisions should be made with careful consideration and in complete trust.

### Who should have a will?

If you're an adult in BC who falls into any of the following categories,
you should strongly consider having a will:

- You own property, including real estate, vehicles, and/or other assets;
- You have a dependent spouse or children;
- You wish to have someone they know and trust take care of your estate after your death.

We will prepare a will that fits your needs at a reasonable cost.
If you own assets in British Columbia as well as around the world,
it is possible to have a will that relates only to your BC assets.
