### Powers of Attorney

A power of attorney (also known in its shortened form as POA) is a personal planning document which
authorizes another person (attorney) to act on their behalf. There are different types of powers of
attorney (general, enduring, specific), each of which is used in differing circumstances.

A power of attorney gives the attorney authority to make decisions on behalf of the donor when they are
unable to act for themselves. Specific powers of attorney are most commonly used to assist in the
purchase or sale of property, or even for purchasing and/or leasing vehicles. Enduring powers of
attorney are most commonly discussed in conjunction with other personal planning documents with older
adults. A power of attorney can be revoked or changed at any time.
